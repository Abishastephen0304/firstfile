            <p>Sunset is distinct from twilight, which is divided into three stages. The first one is civil twilight, which begins once the Sun has disappeared below the horizon, and continues until it descends to 6 degrees below the horizon. The second phase is nautical twilight, between 6 and 12 degrees below the horizon. As for the third one, it is astronomical twilight, which is the period when the Sun is between 12 and 18 degrees below the horizon
